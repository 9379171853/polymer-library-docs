Polymer App Toolbox is a collection of components, tools and templates for
building modern web apps with Polymer. App Toolbox features:

-   Component-based architecture using Polymer and web components.
-   Responsive design using the [app layout components](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/app-layout).
-   Modular routing using the
    [`<app-route>`](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/app-route) elements.
-   Localization with
    [`<app-localize-behavior>`](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/app-localize-behavior).
-   Turnkey support for local storage with
    [app storage elements](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/app-storage).
-   Offline caching as a progressive enhancement, using service workers.
-   Build tooling to support serving your app multiple ways: unbundled for
    delivery over HTTP/2 with server push, and bundled for delivery over HTTP/1.

You can use any one of these components separately, or use them together to build a full-featured
Progressive web app. Most importantly, each component is _additive_. For a simple app you may only
need app-layout. As it gets more complicated, you can add routing, offline caching, and a
high-performance server as required.

To get started, see the section on [Application templates](templates).
